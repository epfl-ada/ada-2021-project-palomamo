# Project Milestone 2

2) How differently are women represented in English newspapers compared to men? The first aspect to consider is the proportion of quotation written by women against men. Then, we could try to determine which subjects are more present in men quotations compared to women's, in order to see if we can see some differences. We could perform some unsupervised pattern matching to classify the subjects of articles, as different subjects represent different patterns.

Abstract: A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

How differently are women represented in English newspapers compared to men? The first aspect to consider is the proportion of quotation written by women against men. Then, we could try to determine which subjects are more present in men quotations compared to women's, in order to see if we can see some differences. We could perform some unsupervised pattern matching to classify the subjects of articles, as different subjects represent different patterns.

Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
- Over time span 2015-2020, which newspaper have the most/least equally distributed author gender?
- How can we interpret results for non-binary authors?
- Which subjects are more present in women quotations?
- Which subjects are more present in men quotations?
- Which subjects have seen their author gender proportion the most during the time span 2015-2020?
- How does the gender proportion in general in [OUR COUNTRY] compare with the one of [ANOTHER COUNTRY]?
